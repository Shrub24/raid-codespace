      "Canberra sits within the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), which comprises an area of approximately 900 square kilometers. The city is located centrally to Australia and was designed with a focus not only as administrative capital but also aimed at providing space for urban planning that could cater efficiently in terms of transport links connecting it directly, via road or railways.\n",
      "\n",
      "The city's most notable landmarks are the Australian War Memorial (which commemorates those who have served during wars), National Gallery of Victoria which houses Australia's best collection of paintings; and Parliament House - home to all three branches: Executive branch – composed of Head of State and Ministers for each department is housed in this building, Legislative Branch – comprised by Federal Houses of Representatives & Senate along with the Library. The Judiciary system also maintains its offices here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from being an administrative center it has become a significant cultural hub as well; hosting various events like festivals (such as Sydney Festival) which showcase diverse talents and arts ranging across dance to music etc., while maintaining strong connections between Australia, Asia-Pacific regions through regular meetings held under the auspices of Pacific Alliance Forum. In addition there is also ongoing development within urban spaces such as Westfield shopping centers designed with eco-friendly sustainability principles in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion Canberra serves its citizens well both administratively and culturally making it an ideal capital for Australia's unique nationhood identity reflected globally too; from housing significant landmarks to nurturing strong ties between regional neighbors - demonstrating the essence of unity held together by shared values amongst Australians.\n"
